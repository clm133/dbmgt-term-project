CS1555 - Term Project, Milestone 3

////// How to Use Facespace.java ///////

- Before running Facespace.java, be sure to run the db_creation.sql and db_datageneration.sql
  located in the milestone_1 folder.

- The username and password asked by the prompt upon starting Facespace.java are the oracle
  server credentials (in a student's case the username is their pitt username and the password
  is their peoplesoft number)

- Facespace.java presents the user with a numbered menu of options, each calling a different function
  required by the project --i.e. an input of '1' will call the createUser() function. The final menu 
  item(15) will run an automated test, demonstrating ALL of the functions in sequence.
